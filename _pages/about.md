About 
======
I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the guidance of Prof. Can YANG. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

My research interets include statistical machine learning and statistical genetics and genomics.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing ping-pong (skillful), running, fitness and listening to music (I am a big fan of Elvis Presley, Queen, the Beatles, Tatsuro Yamashita, and classical musicðŸ¤©)

This website serves as my academic homepage, where I share my publications, research updates, teaching materials, and other professional activities.
