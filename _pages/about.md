I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I am researching advanced machine learning algorithms for real-world applications. My interests span data science, deep learning, and their applications in computer vision and natural language processing.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in statistics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing ping pong, and contributing to open-source projects.

This website serves as my academic homepage, where I share my publications, research updates, teaching materials, and other professional activities.
