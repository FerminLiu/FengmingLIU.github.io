I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) under the guidance of Prof. Can YANG. My research interests include data science, statistical machine learning, and statistical genetics and genomics.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing ping-pong, running and fitness.

This website serves as my academic homepage, where I share my publications, research updates, teaching materials, and other professional activities.
